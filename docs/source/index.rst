uproot
==================================

**Minimalist ROOT I/O in pure Python and Numpy.**

uproot (or Î¼proot, for "micro-Python ROOT") is a demonstration of how little is needed to read data from a ROOT file. Only about a thousand lines of Python code can convert ROOT TTrees into Numpy arrays.

It is important to note that uproot is *not* maintained by the `ROOT project team <https://root.cern/>`_ and it is *not* a fully featured ROOT replacement. Think of it as a file format library, analogous to h5py, parquet-python, or PyFITS. It just reads (and someday writes) files.
